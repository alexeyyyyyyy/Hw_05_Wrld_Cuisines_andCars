                    Traditional cuisine<br>
                    Japanese cuisine is based on combining the staple food, which is steamed white rice or gohan (御飯),
                    with one or more okazu, "main" or "side" dishes.<br> This may be accompanied by a clear or miso soup
                    and
                    tsukemono <br> The phrase ichijū-sansai (一汁三菜, "one soup, three sides") refers to the
                    makeup of a typical meal served but has roots in classic kaiseki, honzen, and yūshoku cuisine.<br>
                    The
                    term is also used to describe the first course served in standard kaiseki cuisine nowadays.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The origin of Japanese "one soup, three sides" cuisine is a dietary style called Ichiju-Issai (一汁一菜,
                    "one soup, one dish"),<br> tracing back to the Five Great Zen Temples of the 12-century Kamakura
                    period (Kamakura Gozan), developed as a form of meal that emphasized frugality and simplicity.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rice is served in its own small bowl (chawan), and each main course item is placed on its own small
                    plate (sara) or bowl (hachi) for each individual portion.<br> This is done even in Japanese homes.
                    This
                    contrasts with Western-style home dinners in which each individual takes helpings from large serving
                    dishes of food placed in the middle of the dining table.<br> Japanese style traditionally abhors
                    different flavored dishes touching each other on a single plate, so different dishes are given their
                    own individual plates as mentioned or are partitioned using, for example, leaves.<br> Placing main
                    dishes on top of rice, thereby "soiling" it, is also frowned upon by traditional etiquette.<br>

                    Mexican cuisine<br> consists of the cooking cuisines and traditions of the modern country of Mexico.
                    Its
                    earliest roots lie in Mesoamerican cuisine.<br> Its ingredients and methods begin with the first
                    agricultural communities such as the Olmec and Maya who domesticated maize, created the standard
                    process of nixtamalization, and established their foodways.<br> Successive waves of other
                    Mesoamerican groups brought with them their cooking methods. These included: the Teotihuacanos,
                    Toltec, Huastec, Zapotec, Mixtec, Otomi, Purépecha, Totonac, Mazatec, Mazahua, and Nahua.<br> With
                    the
                    Mexica formation of the multi-ethnic Triple Alliance (Aztec Empire), culinary foodways became
                    infused (Aztec cuisine).<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today's food staples native to the land include corn (maize), turkey, beans, squash, amaranth, chia,
                    avocados, tomatoes, tomatillos, cacao, vanilla, agave, spirulina, sweet potato, cactus, and chili
                    pepper.<br> Its history over the centuries has resulted in regional cuisines based on local
                    conditions,
                    including Baja Med, Chiapas, Veracruz, Oaxacan, and the American cuisines of New Mexican and
                    Tex-Mex.<br>

                    Middle Ages<br>

                    John, Duke of Berry enjoying a grand meal. The Duke is sitting with a cardinal at the high table,
                    under a luxurious baldaquin, in front of the fireplace, tended to by several servants, including a
                    carver.<br> On the table to the left of the Duke is a golden salt cellar, or nef, in the shape of a
                    ship; illustration from Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, circa 1410.
                    In French medieval cuisine, banquets were common among the aristocracy.<br> Multiple courses would
                    be
                    prepared, but served in a style called service en confusion, or all at once.<br> Food was generally
                    eaten by hand, meats being sliced off in large pieces held between the thumb and two fingers. The
                    sauces were highly seasoned and thick, and heavily flavored mustards were used.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pies were a common banquet item, with the crust serving primarily as a container, rather than as
                    food itself,<br> and it was not until the very end of the Late Middle Ages that the shortcrust pie
                    was
                    developed.<br>

                    Meals often ended with an issue de table, which later changed into the modern dessert,<br> and
                    typically
                    consisted of dragées (in the Middle Ages, meaning spiced lumps of hardened sugar or honey),<br> aged
                    cheese, and spiced wine, such as hypocras.<br>
